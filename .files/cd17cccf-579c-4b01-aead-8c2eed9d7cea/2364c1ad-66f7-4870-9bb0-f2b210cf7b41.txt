Effects of Fusion Techniques on Multi -Modal Dataset                               |Python , Keras , FER, HuggingFace, Scikit -Learn, Transformers  
• Investigated the effects of 3 fusion techniques  viz, decision -level, feature -level, and hybrid on Facial Expression Recognition 
models over multi -modal datasets (video, text, and audio) for emotion detection  
• Experimented with ensembles of EK-GCN (uses external knowledge sentiment lexicons and POS) HateBERT ,, Vader, XLSR -
emotion (Speech Emotion Detection), and EmoReact , HSEmotion ,  for feature extraction and emotion classification
